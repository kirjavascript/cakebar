**work in progress**

cakeybar is a customizable statusbar for your windowmanager

* solid multimonitor support
* easy layout model
* flexible theming with CSS
* i3 components: mode, window, workspaces
* system tray integration (kind of)
* image support

currently only i3 is supported though this may be expanded in future
